  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This document will describe how the MAS 500 builder process works and what features are available.&nbsp;
    If you have any questions, please contact one of the following:

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <table border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" valign="top">
        Today we have well over 1000 Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Managed projects that make up the MAS 500 product suite.&nbsp;
        A VB project may include source code that is shared by many other projects.&nbsp;
        For example; the general.bas module is shared by almost every VB project in MAS 500 today.&nbsp;
        In addition, each VB project contains references to an array of ActiveX controls and OLE Automation servers (COM Objects).&nbsp;
        Finally, when a VB project is compiled there are many parameters that must be set consistently across the product like Version numbers, Version information, etc.
        <p>
          When VB projects are complied on many different machines it is very easy to have inconsistencies.&nbsp;
          For example; if the machines do not have the same common source, controls, or the developers do not set the compilation options correctly, the VB project will be compiled with the incorrect information.
        </p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    It is also important to make sure we compile every project that must go into the final product.&nbsp;
    If we miss a project or compile an old one we reduce the quality of the product.
  </p>
  <p>
    Does Source Safe contain the most current <strong>tested</strong> source?&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp;
    While Source Safe contains the most current source in general, the source is not always tested.&nbsp;
    Many developers use Source Safe as a backup or to manage their changes.

  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>To address these problems the build process will incorporate the following features and procedures.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The build process will run unattended on a daily basis.</li>
    <li>
      The build process will by default perform incremental builds.&nbsp;
      This means that VB projects will not be extracted from Source Safe and compiled unless identified by the developer, project manager, or configuration administrator.
    </li>
    <li>
      The build process will build every VB project when instructed to or when shared components are changed.&nbsp;
      This includes common source and object references that have new class id's.
    </li>
    <li>Developers and project managers will explicitly promote their projects into the build process.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>The process</h2>
  <p>The following are the steps to the process.&nbsp; Please review the steps and complete them as instructed.</p>

        You can also query any other module, project manager, or developer by selecting the value in the combo boxes: Manager, Module, and Developer, then pressing the Query button.&nbsp;

        The difference with Manager assignment is that any manager can assume the Project Manager role of any project.&nbsp;
        This is designed to allow managers to make the needed decisions during busy times.&nbsp;
        As a rule, managers should not take control of a project unless agreed upon by the current project manager.

        Project promotion is used to explicitly identify to the build process when to <em><strong>extract</strong></em> new source code.&nbsp;
        When the build process runs it will extract (get) from Source Safe the latest version of the code for any project that has a "promote" status.&nbsp;
        If the project was identified as a project to compile the build process will compile that project after the project is extracted from Source Safe.

        To change a project's promotion status, simply change the value of the combo box on the left to the value desired.&nbsp;
        Then when all values are set correctly, press the update button.
        <p>
          <em><strong>Note</strong>: the "Promote All" and "Demote All" buttons will promote or demote all projects on the page.&nbsp;
          This will change the current status of each project and there is no undo so be careful.</em>

              It is expected that developers will promote their own project, but in the absence of the developer the project manager can promote the project.
